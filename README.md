3. Set environment variables in `server/.env`
4. Use PM2: `pm2 start server/index.js`
5. For Netlify frontend: `_redirects` file is included automatically

## Netlify SPA Routing

The `src/_redirects` file is included in the build output:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
This ensures direct URL access works on Netlify.
